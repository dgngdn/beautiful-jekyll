Affordable 3D printers make it easy for everyone to make customized objects in minutes. (OK, maybe **hours**)

I work with a [Monoprice Select Mini](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=21711&gclid=Cj0KCQiAoY7VBRDtARIsAHWoO-KL_RNK_kTRov0NemUT3d-7D_38Bm-bBYiK-AqgOGJDpnlBTBrgET8aAgnEEALw_wcB) which is one of the cheapest no-assembly 3D printers on the market.
